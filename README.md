- It has a homepage with list of movies from API 
- It contains search bar to search movies
- It also has a detail page for each movie
- Implemented custom favorite functionality as part of the test asked to me so you can make any movie to be saved as favorite and can access all favorite movie as well on another list/page as well 
Note : Database is not created for favorite fucntionality and it is being saved in cookie which was a bonus point functionality asked to me.
